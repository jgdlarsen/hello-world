# hello-world
This is my first project, be gentle
Well I am now learning how to code. 
I am takeing online courses at team tree house. I have learned html and CSS.
Next is JSON.
I work with someone her name is Eklas I have learned so much from her and I wish I can learn more and by the way she is not just another pretty face. She is smart and catches on very quickly.
A bit hormonal and impatient but I am not the easiest person to get along with, I am once divorced, lol.
