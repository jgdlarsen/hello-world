# hello-world
This is my first project, be gentle
Well I am n learning how to code. I am takeing online courses at team tree house. I ahve learned html and CSS.
Next is JSON.
I work with someone her name is Eklas and she is not just another pretty face. She is smart and catches on very quickly.
A bit hormonal and impatient but I am not the easiest person to get along with, I am once divorced, lol.
